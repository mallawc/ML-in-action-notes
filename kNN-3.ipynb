    "构造k-近邻分类器的手写识别系统需要处理的数据对象为：图像数据。为了简单起见，这里构造的系统只能识别数字0到9，需要识别的数字已经使用图形处理软件，处理成具有相同色彩和大小，宽高为32x32像素的黑白图像。尽管采用文本格式存储图像不能有效利用内存空间，但是为了方便理解还是将图像转换为文本格式：\n",

    "实际使用kNN的时候会发现算法的效率不高。因为算法需要为每一个测试向量做2000次距离计算，每个距离计算包括了1024个维度浮点运算，总计要执行900次，此外，还需要为测试向量准本2MB的存储空间，可见kNN算法的空间和计算的开销是非常大的。\n",

    "k近邻算法是分类数据最简单有效的算法，实际使用算法时我们必须有接近实际数据的训练样本数据。k近邻算法必须保存全部数据集，如果训练集非常大，必须使用大量的存储空间，此外由于必须对数据集中每个数据计算距离值，实际使用时可能非常耗时。\n",
    "\n",
    "k近邻的另一个缺陷是：它无法给出任何数据的基础结构信息，因此我们也无法知晓平均实例样本和典型实例样本具有什么特征。"
